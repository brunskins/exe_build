# exe_build
make a simple exe with a small and light weight graphical user interface for pyinstaller

then select which file you want to convert to an exe (must be a python file)

the completed exe will be located where the exe builder file is located in the dist folder

***note the exe wont be made if the path to the exe or the exe file name has any spaces in it so purge spaces before hand ***

***note you will need to have pyinstaller installed***
